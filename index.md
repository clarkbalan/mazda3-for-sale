    <h2>Car Features</h2>
    <h3>The Good</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Second owner:</strong> I bought the car in 2015 with 23,000 miles. The first owner maintained it at a Mazda dealership.</li>
      <li><strong>Headlights:</strong> Professionally modified using high-quality components from <a href="https://www.theretrofitsource.com/" target="_blank">The Retrofit Source</a>. Features Osram Xenarc $100 bulbs that are super bright but don't blind oncoming traffic. Includes a "purple flicker" effect, typically seen in high-end cars like Mercedes and Lexus. The LED daytime running strip also acts as turn signals, and the headlights were sealed properly with no issues. Additionally, the headlights rotate into the turn, a premium feature typically found in high-end Mazda models, improving visibility around corners at night.</li>
      <li><strong>Mechanical reliability:</strong> No engine or mechanical issues. Never had a check engine light. Assembled in Japan, known for quality manufacturing.</li>
      <li><strong>Heat:</strong> The car's heat works really well, providing excellent warmth in cold weather.</li>
      <li><strong>Tires and wheels:</strong> New tires and wheels replaced less than 10 months ago in late 2023. OEM disk brakes with 20-30K miles left on the pads.</li>
      <li><strong>Leather seats:</strong> Black leather seats with minimal wear.</li>
      <li><strong>AC:</strong> The air conditioning works perfectly with no smell, thanks to regular cleaning of the evaporator core.</li>
      <li><strong>Optima Yellow Battery:</strong> Reliable battery, recently installed.</li>
      <li><strong>Security camera system:</strong> Pre-wired into the fuse box for front and rear security cameras, which continue to monitor the car even when it's off (parking security feature).</li>
      <li><strong>Oil and maintenance:</strong> Engine oil has been serviced regularly with FULL Synthetic Royal Purple 10W-20 oil every 10K miles. The last oil change was in September 2024.</li>
      <li><strong>Spark plugs:</strong> Replaced with original Japanese NGK spark plugs at 110K miles.</li>
      <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> Transmission serviced by dropping the pan, replacing the fluid and filter, and cleaning the magnet at around 80K miles.</li>
      <li><strong>Power steering fluid:</strong> Flushed and replaced in Summer 2023.</li>
      <li><strong>Drive belt:</strong> Replaced in Summer 2022.</li>
      <li><strong>Brakes:</strong> Brake fluid flushed every 3 years, using ATE Original TYP 200 Racing Quality DOT 4 Brake Fluid. Original OEM rotors and pads with plenty of life left.</li>
      <li><strong>Cabin air filter:</strong> Replaced every 9-12 months. The AC evaporator core is cleaned annually with Lubegard Kool-It.</li>
      <li><strong>Sound system:</strong> The Bose sound system is excellent via AUX or Bluetooth. Dynamat sound deadening material installed on the driver's door for improved sound and reduced road noise.</li>
      <li><strong>New components:</strong> Front sway bar links, stabilizer links, and both front axles were replaced in Summer 2023. Front and rear struts and springs were replaced in 2023.</li>
      <li><strong>Paperwork and extras:</strong> The car comes with a clean title, the original manual, wheel locks (with the key), and receipts for recent tire and wheel replacements.</li>
      <li><strong>Accident history:</strong> No accidents or major repairs. A minor incident was reported in 2017 where someone lightly rolled into the front bumper. There was no damage, but it is noted on the CarFax report.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Bad</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Driver seat heater:</strong> The heat only works for the back portion of the driver seat; the bottom seat heater stopped working, most likely due to a failed heating pad under the seat. It can be serviced.</li>
      <li><strong>Trunk light:</strong> The trunk LED light is torn off and does not work. It can be fixed.</li>
      <li><strong>Transmission oil pan leak:</strong> A small leak is present, likely due to the silicone seal on the pan. You may need to top off transmission oil every 3-6 months. It’s recommended to replace the silicone gasket during the next oil change in 6-12 months.</li>
      <li><strong>AC evaporator maintenance:</strong> I recommend cleaning the AC evaporator coil annually with Lubegard Kool-It to prevent odors caused by bacteria buildup.</li>
      <li><strong>Remote lock keys:</strong> The car has two remote lock keys. One of the keys drains its battery quickly, every two weeks, and becomes weaker over time. Both keys show signs of wear.</li>
      <li><strong>Interior wear and tear:</strong> Normal wear in some areas, particularly on the driver's seat where the leather is separating. The driver's floor mat has a hole and may need replacement.</li>
      <li><strong>Front struts:</strong> Occasionally, the front struts make noise over large bumps. It should be inspected.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Security camera:</strong> If leaving the car parked for more than 3 days, I recommend disconnecting the security camera from the battery. While the Thinkware security cameras have a battery protection feature that cuts off the camera when the battery drops below a certain level, I've seen that it can still get the battery low enough where the car may need a jumpstart.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintenance products:</strong> I recommend using <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lubegard-96030-Evaporator-Heater-Cleaner/dp/B0007PHD0S/ref=sr_1_1" target="_blank">Lubegard Kool-It Evaporator and Heater Foam Cleaner</a> once a year to clean the AC evaporator and prevent any bad smells from forming due to bacteria buildup.</li>
    </ul>
