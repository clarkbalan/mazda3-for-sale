<div class="section main-content">
  <h2>Step 1: Initial Contact</h2>
  <p>Feel free to contact me via the following methods:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phone:</strong> Call between 5 PM - 10 PM at <a href="tel:+13852460055">385-246-0055</a></li>
    <li><strong>Text:</strong> Anytime at <a href="sms:+13852460055">385-246-0055</a></li>
    <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:mazda3forsale@sudomail.com">mazda3forsale@sudomail.com</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2: Viewing & Test Drive</h2>
  <p>Once we schedule a time, we can meet at a public location where you can inspect the car in person. If you would like to test drive the car, please bring your valid driver’s license.</p>
  <p>Before the test drive, I will ask you to sign a <strong>Test Drive Agreement Form</strong>, which releases me from liability during the test drive. You can download and review the form here:</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Optional Mechanic Inspection</h2>
  <p>If you'd like, I’m happy to arrange for the car to be inspected by a mechanic of your choice. You can schedule the appointment, and I will take the car to the mechanic for the inspection (at your expense). This ensures full transparency on the car's condition.</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Finalizing the Sale</h2>
  <p>If you decide to purchase the car, here’s what happens next:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Payment will be accepted via <strong>cash</strong> or <strong>cashier’s check</strong> only.</li>
    <li>We will meet at your bank to verify the cashier’s check, or if paying in cash, we will finalize the transaction at a safe, public location.</li>
    <li>I will sign over the Utah Certificate of Title to you, along with a bill of sale for your records. This ensures everything is legally transferred.</li>
    <li>You will take the signed title to the Utah DMV to complete the transfer and register the vehicle in your name.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 5: After the Sale</h2>
  <p>Once the sale is complete, I will notify the Utah DMV by submitting a Notice of Sale, which releases me from any liability with the vehicle. It is then up to you to register the vehicle in your name and pay any applicable fees at the DMV.</p>
